# Shopping Mall Customer Segmentation Using AI & ML

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform customer segmentation using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to segment shopping mall customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior, helping businesses tailor their marketing strategies more effectively. We will use **K-means clustering**, one of the most popular unsupervised learning techniques, to achieve this.

```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `mall_customers.csv`. It contains the following features:

- **CustomerID**: Unique customer identifier.
- **Gender**: Gender of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **Annual Income (k$)**: Annual income of the customer in thousand dollars.
- **Spending Score (1-100)**: The spending score assigned to the customer by the shopping mall, based on customer behavior and purchase data.

## Approach

1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Analyze and visualize the features to understand patterns.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handle missing values, normalize or scale the data as needed.
   
3. **Clustering Algorithm**:
   - Use **K-means clustering** to group customers based on their income and spending habits.
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using **Elbow Method**.
   
4. **Evaluation and Visualization**:
   - Visualize the clustered groups using **2D plots**.
   - Analyze the segments to derive business insights.

## Requirements

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Key Libraries:
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: Numerical computing.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning algorithms (K-means).
- **plotly** (optional): Interactive visualization.

## Usage

### 1. Run Jupyter Notebook:
You can explore the entire segmentation process using the provided notebook.

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/customer_segmentation.ipynb
```

### 2. Run the Python Scripts:
If you prefer running Python scripts:

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  ```bash
  python src/data_preprocessing.py
  ```

- **Build and Apply the Clustering Model**:
  ```bash
  python src/clustering_model.py
  ```

- **Visualize the Clusters**:
  ```bash
  python src/visualize_clusters.py
  ```

### 3. Interpreting the Clusters:
The output will generate different customer segments that can be interpreted as follows:
- **High Income, Low Spending**
- **Low Income, High Spending**
- **High Income, High Spending**
- **Moderate Income, Moderate Spending**

These insights can be used to target specific customer segments with appropriate marketing strategies.

## Future Work

- **Improved Clustering Algorithms**: Try hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN, or Gaussian Mixture Models for better results.
- **Feature Engineering**: Add more features like purchase history, customer preferences, etc., to create more detailed segments.
- **AI Recommendations**: Implement AI-based recommendations based on customer segments to suggest personalized products.
